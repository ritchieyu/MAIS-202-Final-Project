# MAIS202
## Project and bootcamp files for MAIS 202 Fall 2020 cohort.
### "amino_acid" contains code for predicting mutations within amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2
### "genome" contains code for predicting mutations within genome sequnce of SARS-CoV-2
### Since SARS-CoV-2 sequence data is limited by time, other viruses, such as influenza, may be used to further test model
### Data is provided by GISAID, however, since access to the data requires registration, I am not allowed to post the data on github
